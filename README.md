# Outlier Removal in Cryo-EM via Radial Profiles

This repository contains an implementation of outlier removal in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) datasets using radial profiles. The method focuses on removing outliers to enhance the quality of the 2D class averages and downstream analysis.

## Setup

1. **Create a Conda environment:**
   
   To set up the required dependencies, create a Conda environment using the provided `requirements.yml` file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f requirements.yml
   conda activate outlier-removal
   
2. **Synthetic Data Experiments:**

    To reproduce the synthetic data experiments, run the following script:
   
    ```bash
    python run_synthetic_experiment.py --use_pure_noise --use_part_particles --use_multi_particles

3. **Real Data Experiments:**

    To reproduce the experiments on real cryo-EM datasets, execute:

    ```bash
       python run_real_data_experiment.py --dataset_name "10028" --extraction_size 360 --outlier_removal

### Requirements:
To run the real data experiments, ensure you have a directory with the following structure:

#### Dataset Directory:
* The directory name should match the dataset name.
   * Contains .mrc files (micrographs).
   * Contains particle picks generated by Relion.
   * Contains CTF (Contrast Transfer Function) corrections for each micrograph.

Example:
An example of the required file structure and data is provided in the 10028 dataset directory.
